        <h2><u>EARLY LIFE:</u></h2><br>
        <ul>
            <li>APJ Abdul Kalam was born into a poor Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage town of Rameswaram, Tamil
                Nadu,
                on October 15, 1931. His mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife and his father, Jainulabdeen, was an<br> imam
                of a
                local mosque and a boat owner. He was the youngest in the family with four elder brothers and a
                sister.<br></li>
            <li>Though, the family was not financially affluent yet all the children were raised in an atmosphere that
                was
                full of love and compassion. In order to add to the family’s income, Kalam had to sell newspapers
                during his
                early years.<br></li>
            <li>He was an average student during his school, but possessed a strong desire to learn and was very hard
                working. He loved mathematics and spent hours studying the subject. He pursued his education from
                ‘Schwartz
                Higher Secondary School,’ and then graduated from ‘Saint Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli,’ in
                1954. He
                wanted to become a fighter pilot but his dream could not be fulfilled as here were only eight
                positions
                available in the IAF and he secured the ninth place.<br></li>

        <h2><u>PERSONAL LIFE</u></h2>
        <img class="img1" src="imgs/r.jpg" width="25%"><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra, followed by
                three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 – 7 March
                2021), Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed.He was extremely close to his elder
                siblings and their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of
                money to his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.<br></li>
            <li>Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He never owned a television, and was in
                the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m.His few personal possessions included
                his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no
                will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him.<br></li>

        <h2><u>PROJECTS:</u></h2><br>
        <img src="imgs/uu.jpg" class="img2" width="25%">
        <p>Here are 5 significant contribution of Dr. Kalam in the field of science and technology:</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li><u>India's first indigenous Satellite launch vehicle</u></li><br>
            <p>At the time, India barely talked about launching satellite and developing in the field of Space and
                technology, a man came and changed the future of space organization. APJ Abdul Kalam was appointed
                as the project director in ISRO and his leadership made it feasible for the country to construct own
                SLV from ground zero. In July 1980, the SLV III injected the Rohini satellite into near-Earth orbit,
                making The country an exclusive Space Club member.</p>
            </li>
            <li><u>Development of Ballistic missiles:</u></li><br>
            <p>Another milestone was created when Dr. kalam headed the directorial position of Devila and Valiant. It
                aimed to produce ballistic missiles based on the successful SLV program's technology. It was only then
                when missiles like AGNI-(intermediate range ballistic missile) and PRITHVI (surface to surface missile)
                along with many powerful missiles were created and that’s why Dr. Kalam earned the title of the missile
                man of India.</p>
            <li><u>Pokhran nuclear test:</u></li><br>
            <p>This one was the unforgettable moment for India when the country finally emerged as a nuclear power. Dr.
                Kalam was then serving as a chief Scientific adviser to the then prime Minister, and he was the brain
                behind the multiple nuclear testing in Pokhran which left the whole world shocked. As the CEO of the
                DRDO from July 1992 to July 1999, he directed the Pokhran II explosions. India is now on the list of
                nuclear-armed states as a result of his efforts and dedication.</p>
            <li><u>Dr. Kalam’s contribution in medical and health care:</u></li><br>
            <p>You are highly mistaken if you think that Dr. APJ Abdul kalam contributed in only engineering and
                aeronautical field because his contribution in Medical is also significant. He collaborated with
                cardiologist Soma Raju and created a budget friendly coronary stent. It is also widely called Kalam-Raju
                stent. The duo went on to design a tablet computer for better health administration in rural areas of
                India in year 2012 known as Kalam-Raju tablet.</p>
            <li><u>Light combat Aircraft project:</u></li><br>
            <p>Dr. Kalam became the first Indian in a leadership position to fly a fighter plane. After specializing in
                Aeronautical engineering from Madras institute of technology, he engrossed himself deeply with India’s
                light combat Aircraft project.</p>

        <h2><u>WRITINGS:</u></h2><br>
        <ul>
            <li>In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to develop India into a "knowledge
                superpower" and a developed nation by the year 2020. He regarded his work on India's nuclear weapons
                programme as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.</li>
            <li>Kalam describes a "transformative moment" in his life when he asked Pramukh Swami, the guru of the BAPS
                Swaminarayan Sampradaya, how India might realise this five-pronged vision of development.</li>
            <li>Kalam took an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology, including a
                research programme for developing biomedical implants. He also supported open source technology over
                proprietary software, predicting that the use of free software on a large scale would bring the benefits
                of information technology to more people.</li>
            <li>Kalam set a target of interacting with 100,000 students during the two years after his resignation from
                the post of scientific adviser in 1999.[21] He explained, "I feel comfortable in the company of young
                people, particularly high school students. Henceforth, I intend to share with them experiences, helping
                them to ignite their imagination and preparing them to work for a developed India for which the road map
                is already available." His dream is to let every student to light up the sky with victory using their
                latent fire in the heart.</li>

            <li>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth"
                at the
                Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some

                but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.</li>
            <li>Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to
                Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J
                Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the
